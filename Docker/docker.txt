#Docker provides a single command that will clean up any resources — images, containers, volumes, and networks — that are dangling (not tagged or associated with a container):
docker system prune

#To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:
docker system prune -a

#REmove all volumes
docker volume prune

#Remove all images
docker images prune

#Use the docker images command with the -a flag to locate the ID of the images you want to remove. This will show you every image, including intermediate image layers. When you’ve located the images you want to delete, you can pass their ID or tag to docker rmi:
docker images -a
docker rmi Image Image


docker ps -a

docker run --name postgresql-dev -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d postgres
